	[0.24e]
	Fixed the build system by changing src/Makefile.am to install lazyrc into the 
	SYSCONF dir.

Sun May  2 00:04:25 BRT 2004
	[0.24d]
	Fixed a bad malloc on cddb_get.c. Thanks Colin Leroy for the hint.
	A few cleanups were also made, and a problem with a missing errno.h was fixed as 
	well.

Mon Apr 28 13:27:14 BRT 2003
	[0.24c]
	Fixed a problem related to the new optimization levels of autoconf (-O2) and the
	error related to ntoh macros on /usr/include/linux/byteorder/generic.h (where a patch 
	for it is available at http://sources.redhat.com/ml/crossgcc/2002-05/msg00073.html). 
	The fix to solve the problem on Lazy was simple, though: just defined CFLAGS on 
	configure.in, avoiding autoconf to set it.

	Added command-line support to specify which CDROM device to use. This option 
	overrides the default one set in lazyrc.

Sun Apr 20 15:03:50 BRT 2003
	[0.24a]
	Added support to *BSD. The code was tested against FreeBSD 4.3.
	Fixed the multiple lame open()/close() in play_cd(). Now the descriptor is sent to 
	the function, being opened once. The return to open(CDDEV) was being wrong checked,
	and so was fixed. Some memory leaks were also removed.

	A lot of bugs were fixed. I spent some time looking for possible buffer overflows,
	and possibilities of such problems to occur were fixed. TAB support on the config 
	file is also recognized now by the 'pseudo-parser'.
	The read() syscall is now also better handled by the software; Lazy no more tryies
	to get everything in a single read() ;)
	Incorporation of the man page created by Shiju p. Nair was also done.

	[0.23c]
	Woops.. fixed the 'overlap' flag to zero. The old value was letting the music to be
	interrupted sometimes.

	[0.23b]
	Okay.. a feature to use digital extraction was implemented. Now, if one doesn't have
	an analog cable plugged from the CD-ROM drive into the soundcard, the '-d' flag can
	be useful. I didn't implement the '-t' features on it. If you want it, do it yourself 
	and send me a patch later.
	I still didn't have enough time to check for the 'update' freedb feature. I still
	need to fix some sockets bugs I know exists.

	[0.23a]
	Added support to send data to the CDDB server. The program is being submited to the 
    FreeDB to be checked for eventual bugs. The program was also completely rewritten 
    in order to correctly deal with GNU-based operating systems. Lazy now shows always 
    the playlist, rather than only when using verbose mode. Aah, removed a getpid() 
    that was not being used! :)

	[0.22d]
	Corrected a bug when skipping the last track. Now, if you do it, it will abort the
	program, and will not keep playing the song.. :)
	Also added the option to stop the program by pressing '' 2 times.
	Removed the display of music offsets when using the VERBOSE option. I think normal
	users won't see that 'garbage'. If you want to see it, please change the DEBUG
	variable in the playcd.c to '1'.
 
Mon Feb 19 00:50:01 BRST 2001
	[0.22c]
	Corrected a bug discovered when trying to skip a track, when running lazy with the
	-t option.
	
Sat Feb 17 02:46:37 BRST 2001
	[0.22c]
	Finally added an option to skip tracks. Now when the music is playing, you can press
	CTRL-C to skip it, or CTRL-BREAK to quit the program.
	
Fri Feb 16 16:50:21 BRST 2001
	[0.22b]
	Added a new feature: '-s'. This will only show the tracks in the CD, without playing
	them. It's usefull when you wanna list the track names in a quick way. I've changed
	some problems with the output, the album name was still being printed with an extra
	space in the end. I've also changed a little mistake: when -o was informed with an 
	invalid	track, it was printing 'track-1' instead of 'track'.

Mon Feb 12 22:58:32 BRST 2001
	[0.22a]
	Discovered a bug when using the -o option.. the music being played was the track+1,
	but the problem has been patched NOW.
	
Mon Feb 12 21:40:03 BRST 2001
	[0.22a]
	Fixed some bugs from the random function.

Sun Feb 11 14:58:43 BRST 2001
	[0.22a]
	Cleaned the code, removing a line which was cutting off some letters from the album
	name some times.

Tue Fev 06 19:07:48 BRST 2001
	[0.22a]
	Received some contribution from Ulysses Almeida <munky@maluco.com.br>:
	Added -r option (random suport)
	Added -l option (list support)

Mon Jan 29 20:56:27 BRST 2001
	[0.21c]
	Corrected a little bug: now showing "Track time: 6:06" instead of "Track time: 6: 6".
	Changed the '-s' option (to stop the music when the program exit) to the '-k' option
	(to keep the music playing when the program exits). The default is now to stop it.
	Changed some comments in the source, too, and added another comments to the .lazyrc
	file.
	
Sat Jan 20 20:55:48 BRST 2001
	[0.21b]
	Added autoconf/automake support

Fri Jan 19 02:34:16 BRST 2001
	[0.21a]
	Added new options to it. Lazy can now close the cd_device, start playing from a given 
	track, stop the music when the program exit, show the remaining time from the track...
	Give a look on the available options running 'lazy -h'. I added also some checks for 
	the existence of the CDDB directory, because I forget it in the 0.19alpha version.
	Aah! Also created a config file to the program, called by $(HOME)/.lazyrc . :)

	I'm just startig to write this file.. I'm too lazy!

  Lazy - A simple CD player with CDDB support to display song titles
------------------------------------------------------------------------


INTRODUCTION:
-------------
	Hello Folks!

	This  is  Lazy, a  *NIX  shell CD player.  My initial idea for this 
	software  was to  have a simple program which  could play  CD's and 
	display Artist and Song names, with an output as simple as the default 
	output from mpg123.


FEATURES:
---------
	Lazy has some options you can set in the cmd line:
	
	$ lazy -h
	Available options:
		-h         : this help
		-v         : verbose mode
		-k         : keep the music playing when the program exits
		-c         : close the tray before playing the disc
		-d         : use digital extraction
		-f <device>: override the CDROM device specified in ~/.lazyrc
		-t[r|e]    : shows the track's elapsed/remaining time
					 e - display elapsed time
					 r - display remaining time
					 if none is specified, behave as set in ~/.lazyrc
					 This function will not work when using digital 
					 extraction. Why? Aah... I don't want to implement
					 that. You can copy+paste the code from playcd.c
					 to digital.c if you want it.
		-r         : play in random mode
		-s         : just show the track names, without playing them
		-l <list>  : play only track numbers given by <list>
		-o <track> : start playing from track <track>
	
	You can combine these options, too:

	$ lazy -cvtr -o 9
	This command will close the CD-tray, show the remaining time, be
	verbose in every step and will start playing from track #9.

	$ lazy -l 1 4 5
	This will play only the tracks #1, #4 and #5
	
	Lazy will *NOT* work when using the random function with the -o option.


CONFIG FILE:
------------
	Lazy also installs a config file in your home, found at ~/.lazyrc.
	These are the configurable settings:
	
	CDDEV=/dev/cdrom                # the CDROM device
	AUDIODEV=/dev/dsp               # the AUDIO dev, used by digital extr.
	ADDRESS=freedb.freedb.org       # the CDDB server address
	PORT=888                        # the CDDB server port
	CDDB_PATH=~/cddb                # path to the local cddb_dir
	REMAINING | ELAPSED             # display remaining or elapsed time
